#### Introduction:
VanillaJS is a term for library/framework free javascript. 

Its sometimes ironically referred to as a library, as a joke for people who could be seen as mindlessly using different frameworks.

Here's the [official webisite of Vanilla JS]( http://vanilla-js.com/). (It's just a funny website)

#### Javascript:
Acording to MDN-
> JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.


Basically it's a language in which we can write live-scripts in webpages and much more.
**And no, it has nothing to do with Java and no prior knowledge of Java is required.**


A decade back, it was just used to annoy people on internet.

Now it's much more than that, it has something for everyone.
 It can be used for front-end, back-end, app development, etc

 #### Create your first javascript program

Javascript requires an interpreter to execute the code. Every web browser has its own Javascript engine, each with a different name.
>Chrome: V8 engine
